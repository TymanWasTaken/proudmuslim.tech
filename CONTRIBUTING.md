## Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) installed.
- Install mdbook using `cargo install mdbook`, and ensure that the cargo bin directory is in your PATH. 

## Testing Locally

- After you have cloned the repository and made some changes, you can view them locally by running `mdbook serve` from repository directory and navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your preferred web browser.

## Guidelines For Submitting Pull Requests

* Everything you contribute must be factual to the best of your knowledge.
* It should be grammar and spelling error free (you can request help from me, Proudmuslim#2900, if you are unsure about your work meeting this requirement).
* There should not be excessive commit spam, as it gets in the way when looking through changes. See [this article](https://gitbetter.substack.com/p/how-to-squash-git-commits) on squashing commits if they start to become excessive.
