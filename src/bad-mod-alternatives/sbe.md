| [**SkyblockAddons**](https://biscuit.codes/mods/Skyblockaddons/downloadversion/?v=1.5.5) | You know what this is. | [Biscuit](https://biscuit.codes/) |
| [**Cowlection**](https://github.com/cow-mc/Cowlection/releases) | Has some miniscule features, but they're cool nonetheless: [**List of features**]( https://github.com/cow-mc/Cowlection/blob/master/README.md) | [Cow](https://github.com/cow-mc/) |
| [**Danker's Skyblock Mod**](https://github.com/bowser0000/SkyblockMod/releases) | Has many features that SBE has as well as many unique features you won't find in any other Skyblock mods: [**List of features**](https://github.com/bowser0000/SkyblockMod/blob/development/README.md) | [Danker](https://github.com/bowser0000) |

Note: It is not recommended that you use SkyblockCatia either since that mod has a large amount of incompatibilities with other mods, along with a bunch of features that aren't even for Skyblock, making it a very bloated mod.
