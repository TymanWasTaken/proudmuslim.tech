| [**Skytils**](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod/releases) | Even more cool shit: [**List of features**](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod/blob/main/README.md) | [Sychic](https://github.com/Sychic) and [Lily](https://github.com/My-Name-Is-Jeff) |
| [**Patcher**](https://sk1er.club/mods/patcher) | Performance enhancements, bug fixes, and QOL changes: [**List of features**](https://github.com/LunaNotdev/Patcher-Explanation) | [Asbyth](https://github.com/asbyth) ([Sk1erLLC](https://github.com/sk1erllc/)) |
| [**SkyblockAddons**](https://biscuit.codes/mods/skyblockaddons/downloadversion/?v=1.5.5) | You know what this is | [Biscuit](https://biscuit.codes/) |
| [**Cowlection**](https://github.com/cow-mc/Cowlection/releases) | Has some cool things that are miniscule but are cool nonetheless | [Cow](https://github.com/cow-mc/) |
| [**PetInfo**](https://github.com/CroSafan/PetInfo/releases/) | Pet Info HUD. NEU has this too but this one is more simple and more like SBE | [CroSafan](https://github.com/CroSafan) |
| [**Danker's Skyblock Mod**](https://github.com/bowser0000/SkyblockMod/releases) | *info needed here, original doc wasn't very descriptive* |

Note: It is not recommended that you use SkyblockCatia either since that mod has a bunch of incompatibilities with other mods and has a bunch of features that aren't even for skyblock, making it the bloatiest mod I've ever seen.

# Reasons NOT to Buy SBE:
- [**Shitty puzzle solvers v1**](https://imgur.com/a/2xcDUBN)
- [**Crashes v1**](https://imgur.com/a/nXh749Y)
- [**Obfuscated to fuck**](https://imgur.com/a/41aSbvw)
    - Context: This means we cant read the code unless we spend hours decrpyting it, meaning it is really unsafe, and also that it can hide stolen code. Also if you crash, no one fuckin knows why because the crashlog is just spam of iIiIiIiiIIiIiiIiIiiiIiIiIiIiiIiiiiIIIiiIiIiiIiiIiIiiIiiIiii
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v1**](https://imgur.com/a/xQm7jeN) (no one is going to want to help you after this)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v2**](https://imgur.com/a/zanoqTA) (i dont understand how you can fuck up this badly)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v3**](https://imgur.com/a/tFODSqR) (its not even funny anymore)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v4**](https://imgur.com/a/ZqTvjuf) (it's just depressing at this point)
- **Blatantly steals from DSM** (can't find screenshot but its the tic tac toe solver, it's literally the same thing)
- [**Blatantly steals from SBC**](https://imgur.com/a/TpkgDGU)
- [**Blatantly steals from Patcher**](https://imgur.com/a/rjNF5aT)
    - Context: When patcher 1.5 was in beta and 1.12 crop hitboxes were added, they were bugged and were pretty broken. When Complex "made" his version, he somehow managed to produce the exact same fuckin bug. Fishy. Then Moulberry came in and fixed the glitch, and not soon after, Complex also magically found out how to fix it.
- [**Blatantly steals from NEU**](https://imgur.com/a/wqA6KZA)
    - Context: NEU had originally made a feature that allowed you to retexture skulls with custom models. On the SBE discord, they had specifically stated that they will not be stealing features from other mods and people should not request them to add stolen features, yet they still pull this shit? At the time Moulberry was pretty pissed at SBE for blatantly stealing features and was saying on stream he was going to add dungeon puzzle solvers to make SBE useless which was when they put out that statement, but when Moulberry decided against dungeon puzzle solvers, they went straight back to stealing. Absolute losers.
- **Breaks MC EULA**
    - Mojang can take down the mod at any time and you'd lose $5
- **Performance issues**
    - SBE is notorious for destroying your FPS. Their attempt at fixing it was blatantly stealing patcher fps features.
- **Complex is a shitty human being**
    - Illegally steals other people's work that they spent hundreds of hours on and makes money off of it.

# EVEN IF YOU ALREADY BOUGHT SBE, DO NOT USE IT!

Now that I saved you $5, consider giving that money to me instead.
